League of Legends LCD Panel Plugin v1.0

This application was created to enhance the functionality of the Logitech G510's LCD panel during a 5v5 match of League of Legends. The plugin tracks and (optionally) announces the spawns of neutral monsters throughout the game. 

Included with the download is LeagueOfLegends.xml - a premade profile for use with League of Legends. This can be added to your keyboard's profiles through the Logitech Gaming Software application included with your keyboard's drivers. 

By default, the G1 - G6 keys are assigned to control the timer triggers in the LCD application. The four buttons located under the LCD panel are used for the following features:

Button 1 (Leftmost): This button starts up the timers and should be pressed at the very beginning of a round (when the clock in the upper right corner of your LOL window reads 00:00).

Button 2: Disables the clocks. This should be pressed at the end of a round to disable any future chat callouts.

Button 3: Toggles on/off the spawn announcements. When the timers approach the end of a monster's spawn time, the application will announce that the monster will spawn soon. Once the timer reaches zero, the application announces that the monster has spawned. This options is enabled by default.

Button 4: This button toggles between the progress bar display and the timer display.


Feel free to add an issue if you experience any problems. I wrote this application in a couple hours, so there are probably bugs.
